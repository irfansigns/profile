This product is a worth-buy for kids especially ages 2-3plus when they are mostly engaged in creating messes with pens/pencils around. The product was exactly as described, however, if you write a little harder it is not that easy to remove especially with one press delete button, you have to rewrite somewhere lightly and then press the delete button. So I would recommend it to parents who have kids of this age.
